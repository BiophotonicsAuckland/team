## Sam Hitchman

I am a post-doc with AgResearch working on optical sensing of meat quality.

Currently I am working on processing of OCT data to determine the shear force and the percentage of intramuscular fat in NZ red meat.

## Abi Thampi

I have been working on OCT data processing along with Sam to measure the intramuscualr fat content and the shear force in NZ red meat.
