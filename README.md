## Fred Vanholsbeeck
I am in charge of this directory for one week (14-21 Nov 2018)

I will set up some of the projects and try to get this repository up and running. 

Will choose the next volunteer so everyone has a turn.

## Sam Hitchman

I am a post-doc with AgResearch working on optical sensing of meat quality.

I have written code to read raw OCT data from .tdms into .npy files for use with python.

Currently I am working on processing of OCT data to determine the shear force and the percentage of intramuscular fat in NZ red meat.


## Mykola Zlygostiev

I am a PhD student working on eye studies using FD-OCT.

I don't mind to be the next volunteer.
