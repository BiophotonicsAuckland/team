This is where we present ourselves and what we work on.

## Fred Vanholsbeeck
I am in charge of this directory for one week (14-21 Nov 2018)

I will set up some of the projects and try to get this repository up and running. 

Will choose the next volunteer so everyone has a turn.

## Sam Hitchman

I am a post-doc with AgResearch working on optical sensing of meat quality.

I have written code to read raw OCT data from .tdms into .npy files for use with python.

Currently I am working on processing of OCT data to determine the shear force and the percentage of intramuscular fat in NZ red meat.

## Abi Thampi

I am a PhD student working on OCT to predict the quality of meat in real time. 

I have been working on OCT data processing along with Sam to measure the intramuscualr fat content and the shear force in NZ red meat.
